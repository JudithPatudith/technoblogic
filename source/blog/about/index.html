<h2>A little something about me...</h2>
A graduate from Puppet Labs' Professional Services, Jeff Malnick has been a systems engineer for 10 years starting with the Department of Defense at the Naval Postgraduate School to currently working for SRC:CLR, the foremost platform that brings software security to the development process. Outside of the day-to-day Jeff loves tearing up single track on his mountain bike, building pillow forts in his living room and finding new and often overlooked uses for glitter.
