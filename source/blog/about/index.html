<h2>A little something about me...</h2>
<p>
Hey there,

 I'm Jeff Malnick. I grew up in and around Oakland and Mendocino County in Northern California. I previously worked for the Naval Postgraduate Schools MOVES Institute where I focused on modeling and visualization techniques. Before leaving the Department of Defense I was building some really cool networked tile display environments for remote collaboration using SAGE. As a side gig I was a professional mountain biker and pro-am road racer. I also promote a road race in my home town of Boonville, CA which supports several local bicycle advocacy groups and other community-oriented non-profits. I'm most stoked when I'm tearing up single track in Ft. Ord, Santa Cruz and Bend, OR. I also love photography, nerding out about particle physics, AI and the semantic web.
