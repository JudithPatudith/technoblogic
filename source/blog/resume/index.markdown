##Profile

Proud hacker since birth, always curious about how it works, and finding the right solutions to the hard problems. I bring the scientific method to my work, holding my views tentatively and willingly modify them in the face of new evidence. I love teaching and collaborating on projects big and small. My preferred working space is one where I'm the dumbest person in the room. I play well with others.
